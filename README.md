Supplementary Material for my SER 2022 Poster Presentation "Connecting the DAGs: How to Use a Directed Acyclic Graph to Inform Data Analysis" 

<b>Background:</b> Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are becoming a more commonly used research tool in epidemiology and health research. However, reviews of published DAGs demonstrate flaws in the application of this tool, including incorrectly designed DAGs that do not comply to the underlying rules, as well as references to DAGs without showing the graph or describing how it informed the analysis. Qualitative research suggests that an important barrier to the widespread adoption and improved use of DAGs in epidemiologic and health research is the lack of training materials. In particular, there are few existing examples describing how to translate a given DAG into a valid data analysis plan. <br>

<b>Methods:</b> In this project, we work through a series of published DAGs describing how to translate these into analytic plans for the estimation of causal effects. Steps in this process include DAG factorization, and differentiation between DAG-implied non-parametric modeling choices and parametric modeling decisions that must be added to the information contained in the DAG. <br>

<b>Results:</b> Using DAGs from infectious disease epidemiology, reproductive epidemiology, cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, and social epidemiology, we show how the DAG factorization corresponds to the main data analysis, and how a DAG can used to guide sensitivity analyses and quantitative bias analyses to assess uncertainty related to causal assumptions. <br>

<b>Conclusions:</b> DAGs are critical for data analysis, and incorrect usage of the DAG or the incorrect DAG can lead to inaccurate effect estimates. <br>
